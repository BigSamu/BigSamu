## 👨‍💻 About Me

<details>
<summary><h3> My Coding Journey</h3></summary>

Hey there! 👋 I'm Samuel, a curious engineer and avid learner 🤓 always hungry to soak up new knowledge like a sponge 🧽. I recently made an exciting transition to software development, and I'm now on the hunt for new opportunities to take my skills to the next level 🚀.

My engineering journey began when I pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering 🎓, where I delved into a variety of topics like math ➕, physics 🌎, energy 🔥, mechanics 🛠️, electricity ⚡, finance 💰, and programming 👨‍💻. Yep, you read that right! So many topics! In Chile 🇨🇱, engineering degrees take six years 🤯. However, in my case, I took seven 😱 because I was fascinated about programming and computing 💻. I realized that my passion lay in these areas, and that was where I wanted to take my career.

After finishing my degree 👨‍🎓, I set my sights on building a career in Fintech. I was fortunate enough to work in big tech incumbents 🏢 and investment banks 🏦, where I developed specialized skills. But after six years, I realized that I was drifting away from my passion for coding 👨‍💻, and my skills were just sitting in a drawer 🗄️. That was when I decided to take action and enroll myself in a Full-Stack Development Bootcamp to refresh my skills and pursue an MSc Computing Degree in the UK 🇬🇧 to further my education and pave the way for a software engineering career 🖥.

Nowadays, I keep busy by working as a Lead Instructor in a prestigious coding academy, where I'm constantly helping students to achieve their dreams for a career in tech. Besides that, I am also currently working as a contributor in [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), an open-source library created by AWS for building data-intensive solutions. In my free time ⏱, I'm always learning new trends and technologies 📖 and working on personal projects or jobs as a freelance developer 😎. I'm familiar with a range of Full-Stack technologies, but my favorite languages are Javascript and Python, especially when used with ReactJS and FastAPI frameworks 🙌.

Throughout my career, I've proven my ability to plan, design, and solve real-life problems with a combination of technical and social skills 🤝. I'm excited to join a startup or company as a junior engineer, where I can bring my diverse skill set and experience to contribute to the team's success. 🌟
